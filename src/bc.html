                        <code>ls -lh</code> &ndash; Shows more information about each thing in the folder and
                        shows file sizes in "human-readable" numbers (like 42M or 7G, instead of long numbers)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    <code>cd <b>folder</b></code> &ndash; <i>Change directory</i> &ndash; Navigates to
                    <code><b>folder</b></code>, such that any commands that you use after <code>cd</code> are applied
                    relative to <code><b>folder</b></code>. For example, running <code>cd folder</code> and
                    <code>less file</code> is equivalent to running <code>less folder/file</code>.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>cd ..</code> &ndash; Moves to the folder that contains the one that you are currently in.
                        In other words, changes to the parent directory.
                    </li>

                <li>
                    <code>less <b>file</b></code> &ndash; Opens <code><b>file</b></code> in <code>less</code>, which
                    lets you scroll through <code><b>file</b></code> and search for things within it. In general,
                    <code>less</code> is better for longer files than <code>cat</code>.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>mkdir <b>new-folder</b></code> &ndash; <i>Make directory</i> &ndash; Creates a new folder in
                    the current one, named <code><b>new-folder</b></code>.

                <li>
                    <code>rm <b>file</b></code> &ndash; <i>Remove</i> &ndash; Deletes the file named
                    <code><b>file</b></code>, it does not get sent to any sort of "trash," so be careful when using it.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>rm -rf <b>folder</b></code> &ndash; <i>Remove, recursively, and with force</i> &ndash; Deletes
                    the folder named <code><b>folder</b></code> and everything in it forever. <strong>This is a
                    dangerous command</strong>, if you aren't careful, this command will let you obliterate every file
                    on your computer.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Vim Cheatsheet</h2>
            <p>
                Vim is a terminal-based text editor. Much like Notepad, TextEdit, or Visual Studio Code, Vim lets you
                edit any sort of text file. However, it has one major difference: it runs solely inside of a terminal.
                Vim is also different in another way: Vim is a modal editor, which means that actions like text-editing
                and things like saving are done from different "modes"
            </p>
            <p>
                To start editing a file with vim, just run <code>vim <b>file</b></code>, where <code><b>file</b></code>
                is the name of the text file you want to edit. This will open Vim in its "normal" mode.
            </p>

            <h3>"Normal" Mode Commands</h3>
            <p>
                You can think of normal mode as the mode from which you run commands and enter other modes. A "full"
                Vim cheatsheet could be the size of a small novel, so this cheatsheet only lists the most basic
                commands.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>i</code> &ndash; Switch to "insert" mode, the mode where you can actually type.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>:wq</code>, then press enter &ndash; Save the current file and then quit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>:w</code>, then press enter &ndash; Save the current file, but don't quit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>:q!</code>, then press enter &ndash; Quit without saving.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>"Insert" Mode</h3>
            <p>
                The primary usage of insert mode is typing, so pressing keys do what you would expect in a text editor,
                it will type! However, to exit insert mode, just press escape and you will be back in normal mode.
            </p>

            <h3>An example Vim session</h3>
            <p>
                Below is a walkthrough of what making a file might look like in Vim, and a description of what each step
                does.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <code>vim file.txt</code> &ndash; Start editing <code>file.txt</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>i</code> &ndash; Enter insert mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Type <code>Hello world!</code> &ndash; Types the text, <code>Hello world!</code> into the new file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press escape &ndash; Return to normal mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>:wq</code>, then press enter &ndash; Writes the changes made (i.e. the text
                    <code>Hello world!</code>) to <code>file.txt</code> and leave Vim.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>For more Vim knowledge...</h3>
            <p>
                I suggest the Vim cheat sheet found at
                <a href="https://vim.rtorr.com/" target="_blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">https://vim.rtorr.com/</a>,
                I use it myself whenever I find myself confused on how something works in Vim.
