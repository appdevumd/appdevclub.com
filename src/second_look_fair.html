            <ul>
                <li>
                    This semester, App Dev Club will be primarily project-based. You can choose to work on 
                    any project you want with whoever you want, and we will provide any assistance, resources,
                    and guidance you need.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure to <a href="https://discord.gg/scSeVbTT7G" title="Discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join us on Discord</a>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                If you were with us last semester, you know that we were primarily a workshop-based club. However, this semester,
                we decided to do something a little different. App Dev Club is now going to be entirely project-based, and members
                will be able to come up with their own project ideas without restriction and implement them (in groups or individually - you choose).
            </p>
            <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
            <p>
                As like most other clubs here on campus, communication will be primarily through Discord, so make sure to join 
                our server! Also, our main website can be found <a href="index.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="projects-and-technologies">Projects and Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                If you happen to need assistance or mentorship in your project, we most likely got you covered! App Dev Club has 
                tech leads who are familiar with React Native, Flutter, Swift, React, and backend development in Node and Django
                and are committed to making sure every project gets to completion. If you decide to use a framework or technology
                that was not mentioned earlier, we will do our best to help you out as well.
            </p>
            <h2 id="about">Workshops</h2>
            <p>
                Last but not least, we are not removing workshops entirely. We are just removing most of them and carefully choosing
                the remaining ones so that they are as relevant and useful to members as possible.
